    <H3>Analyse Image</H3>
    <PRE>This tool helps to analyse pixels in image:
-  Set scope of image to analyse part of it.
-  Data can be saved as a html which includes all results.</PRE>
    <H3>Image quantization</H3>
    <PRE>Technique of reducing distinct colors in image is called "Color Quantization".
Different algorithms can be selected for different purposes: 
  - RGB Uniform is fastest and good enough for 256 colors quantization of most images.
  - K-Means Clustering is good for calculating "most different" colors in image.
  - Popularity is good for calculating "most occurred" colors in image.

The basical principle：
  - Map colors from RGB(256*256*256) or HSB(360*100*100) to colors set of defined size(target palette).
  - For algorithms K-Means Clustering and Popularity, there are twice quantizations actually. 
     Colors are preprocessed by algorithm RGB Uniform to produce smaller region, and then
     calculation is run against this colors set.

Options:
  - Since color has 3 dimensions, channels' weights can be balanced to get better mapping.  
  - "Dithering" is to optimize the result of Color Quantization. 
  - The strategies to pick colors for target palette: 
       - "center color" may adjust the quality of the result, but may generate new colors not in original image. 
       - "first color" only take original colors in original image.</PRE>
    <H3>Dithering</H3>
    <PRE>Dithering is a technique to diffuse quantization error to avoid color banding.
It may improve image quality after color quantization(Reduce colors in palette).</PRE>
    <H3>Color matching</H3>
    <PRE>How to match colors: 
1) "Color Distance" indicates the difference between 2 colors.
   "Color difference" can be referred in "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference" 
2) When the distance is less than the defined distance value, it means the 2 colors are "Matched".  
3) When the distance is defined as zero, it means color must be matched accurately.
4) When select multiple colors to compare with pixels in image, their relationship is "OR", 
which means result is TRUE when pixel' color matches any of the selected color.</PRE>
    <H3>Premultiplied alpha</H3>
    <PRE>Some image formats like png/tiff save pixels opacity in separated Alpha channel, called "Straight Alpha".
"Premultiplied Alpha" is that RGB channels are premultiplied by alpha value, 
by which image formats like jpg/bmp without Alpha channel can make effect of pixels opacity too.
Premultiplied Alpha will change values of RGB channels and image can not be recovered 
if the alpha value is missed later. So do not use it if the image should not be changed.</PRE>
    <H3>Thresholding</H3>
    <PRE>The color components of the destination image will contain either the small value or the big value.
For example, when the small value is 0 and the big value 255, after processed, 
the red, green, and blue values of the pixels will be either 0 or 255. 
Thus, the processed image can only contain the following colors:
    black (red = 0, green = 0, blue = 0)
    white (red = 255, green = 255, blue = 255)
    red (red = 255, green = 0, blue = 0)
    green (red = 0, green = 255, blue = 0)
    blue (red = 0, green = 0, blue = 255)
    yellow (red = 255, green = 255, blue = 0)
    magenta (red = 255, green = 0, blue = 255)
    cyan (red = 0, green = 255, blue = 255)</PRE>
    <H3>Repeat/Tile Image</H3>
    <PRE>This tool helps to make background/texture image:
- Select an image, set part or whole of it as input of scaling.
- Scale the selected image part as the cell of repeating.
- Make the target image:
      - Select the repeating type:
            - Repeat the cell with horizontal number and vertical number.
            - Tile the cell into width and height of canvas.
      - Set interval between cells. Negative value may make effect of interleave.
      - Set margins of target image.</PRE>
    <H3>Sample Image</H3>
    <PRE>This function reduces the pixels of an image:
  - Resize and move the rectangle to define the region to pick.
  - Set the width scale and the height scale against the selected region.

    <H3>Manage Colors</H3>
    <PRE>This tool is to manage colors and palettes:
-  Same color can have different names and orders in different palettes.
      - Name and order number of colors can be edited in the table.
      - "Order number" is a float value and can have decimal.
         Example, when assign 5.5 to a color, then it is inserted between the colors with numbers of 5 and 6.
      - Drag-drop colors in palette can adjust their orders too.
      - Click button "Trim order numbers in palette" to rewrite them in step "1.0f".
-  Definitons of colors are saved in list of "All Colors" actually:
      - When delete palette or delete colors from palette, the color definition is not deleted and is still in "All Colors".
      - When delete a color in "All Colors", its definition is removed and it is deleted from all palettes.
      - Same color can be in different palettes and can be duplicated in same palette.
-  When import colors from a file:
      - It should include column "rgba" or "rgb". 
        That is, the file can have only one column which should be either "rgba" or "rgb".
      - The file can include column "name". </PRE>
    <H3>Draw Chromaticity Diagram</H3>
    <PRE>User can input/paste values or open file to load spectrum data.
User data will be validated, calculated and displayed in table automatically, as following rulers:
   - File can include comments or be in some type of format. 
   - Following characters among data are ignored and skipped: 
               " ,  |  {  }  [  ]  \t '
   - Each valid data item should be in same row and includes following 4 values in its front: 
	Wave-Length     X      Y       Z
      Other data in rows will be ignored. That is, only first 4 values in each row will be read)
   - "Wave-Length" should be integer and unit is "nm". X/Y/Z are tristimulus values in double.
     Example of a valid data row:
               435	0.3285	0.01684	1.62296	
   - The data should be already adapted to CIE Illuminant D50.

<H1>Network Tools</H1>
    <H3>Download Htmls</H3>
    <PRE>Following steps are suggested:
1) Set options.
2) Input or paste a web address.
3) The first level links in the web address will be listed for you to select and download.
4) Select useful links. Nonsense links can create unwanted files and disturb final path index.
5) If path index and merged PDF is required, it is important to make files named in correct order.
    For selected links, 
       - Use function "Set subdirectory name" to make subdirectory's name reasonbale.
       - Use functions "Set link name/title/address as file name" to make filenames meaningful.
       - Use function "Add order number before filename" to help filenames ordered.
    MyBox can order names like "xxx9", "xxx36", "xxx157" correctly.  
6) Download the selected links. Monitor their status. Put failed links back in download queue.

To order the table rows:
1) Click column header for ascending order by this column. 
2) Click column header again for descending order by this column.
3) Click column header for thrid time to cancel ordering of this column.
4) Press SHIFT and click more column headers to order by multiple columns.</PRE>
    <H3>Encode/Decode URL</H3>
    <PRE>This tool helps to convert a string from/to the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME format. 

The following rules are applied for encoding:
    - The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain the same.
    - The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
    - The space character "   " is converted into a plus sign "+".
    - All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. 
      Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string "%xy", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte.

Decoding does reverse conversion.</PRE>

       - Range of data rows
       - Column names
       - Row filter
         Notice, data of a row number may be changed when some rows are added or deleted. 
         Example, when insert 2 rows before "row 6", original "row 12" becomes "row 14" while current "row 12" was "row 10". 
         So "row number" is not right way to locate a specific data row while rows number is changing. 
         A way to refer sepcial rows is the expression composed of column values.
- Define values of the style:
       - Font size, colors, bold, etc.
       - More values in format of JavaFx CSS.
- Define title and sequence number of the style.

    <H3>JavaScript</H3>
    <PRE>This tool helps to manage and run codes in JavaScript:
- Edit codes in JavaScript.
  The script can include any valid elments which WebEngine can parse(ECMAScript 6).
- Run the script. 
  Its results are displayed in right pane. And it affects the web page in right pane too.
- Save the script as a node in the codes tree of left pane.</PRE>
    <H3>JShell(Java interactive coding tool)</H3>
    <PRE>JShell is one of tools in JDK:
   - JShell provides capability to interactively evaluate "snippets", as Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). 
   - "Snippet" is a single expression, statement, or declaration of Java programming language code:
           - Semicolons should be in the end of statement while expression need not it.
           - Variables and methods can be defined and called later.
   - Extrenal Java classes should be accessible: 
           - JShell picks "CLASSPATH" of system environment.
           - Other jar files or paths can be appended to "CLASSPATH".  
           - Except for base classes, most of Java classes should be imported before call them.  
   - JShell can be used for scientific computation and Java codes debug.

This tool helps to run JShell in GUI:
   - Input several snippets and click button "Start" to run them: 
   - Snippets are evaluated one by one.
   - Results of snippets will affect later snippets, like "an execution environment".  
   - Attributes of all evaluated snippets will be shown in a table.
   - Click button "Delete" or "Clear" to drop some or all snippets from current environment.
   - Click button "Reset" to empty JShell and environment becomes blank.
   - Press "CTRL+1" to pop list of code completion suggestions.
   - If added MyBox class paths, all methods of MyBox can be referred.</PRE>
    <H3>JEXL(Java Expression Language)</H3>
    <PRE>JEXL(Java Expression Language) is a library to generate values dynamically with variables and scripts.
   - JEXL has different syntax from Java. It is more like javascript. 
   - Before run expression/script, all variables in it should have values held by JexlContext. 
   - Refer to Java classes by creating their instances as local variables. Full package name is required.
   - JEXL can be used for scientific computation and data manufacture.

This tool helps to run JEXL in GUI:
   - Input JEXL expression/script.
     Notice: Use single quotes instead of double quotes to surround strings.
   - Input Java codes of setting JexlContext like following:
                 jexlContext.set("name", value);
     Example, set following to use Math.PI in expression/script:
                 jexlContext.set("Math", Math.class);
   - Input parameters of JEXL script if any. Separate values by comma.
   - Click button "Start" to evaluate the expression/script.
   - MyBox does following in JShell enrionment automatically:
             - Add MyBox library paths to CLASSPATH.
             - Import necessary JEXL packages.
             - Execute codes of JexlContext.
             - Calculate expression/script with parameters(if any).
   - If all variables and paramters have valid values, result is shown in right pane.</PRE>
    <H3>Math Function</H3>
    <PRE>This tool helps to manage and calculate math functions:
- Define math function:
      - List names of variables of the function, separated by English comma.
        The names should satisfy rules of JavaScript:
              - Can include letters, number, underline, and unicodes(like Chinese).
              - Not start with number.
      - Define function expression as a piece of codes in JavaScript:
             - The script can include any valid elments which Nashorn can parse(ECMAScript 5.1).
             - It should be a number finally.
             - It can refer to the given variables, but should not declare them.
      - Define domain of the function as a piece of codes in JavaScript:
             - Blank means the domain is all of real numbers.
             - The script can include any valid elments which Nashorn can parse(ECMAScript 5.1).
             - It should be a boolean value(true or false) finally.
             - It can refer to the given variables, but should not declare them.
      - Give the name of calculation result.
- When the tool calculates a script, 'var <variable_name>=<variable_value>;' are inserted in the head of it before the evaluation.
- If script of domain is not blank, the given values of variables are inserted in it and check the result.
   If true, continue to calculate the script of function expression. Else this set of values is skipped. 
- With defined range, interval, and decimal scale, data set of the function can be generated.
- To unary function, XY chart, including scatter chart and line chart, can be displayed.
- To binary function, XYZ chart, including 3D scatter chart and surface chart, can be displayed.</PRE>
    <H3>Geography Code</H3>
    <PRE>Geography code should:
1) Be subordinate to an existed geography code.
2) Its level should be lower than its ancestors'.
3) Has either Chinese name or English name.

One of following can determine an address:
1) dataid. This is accurate matching.
2) level + ancestors + chinese_name/english_name/alias. This is accurate matching.
3) level + chinese_name/english_name/alias. This is fuzzy matching. Duplaited names in same level can cause false matching.
Matching of name or alias is case-insensitive. 

"dataid" of new Geography Code is assigned by MyBox automatically.</PRE>
    <H3>Map options</H3>
    <PRE>Coordinates of GCJ-02 are  encrypted as offsets of real locations.
Coordinates of CGCS2000 are real locations and approximate to WGS-84(GPS).

Map of TianDiTu accepts coordinates of CGCS2000 and display them at correct locations without offsets.
When display coordinates other than CGCS2000 in map of TianDiTu, MyBox converts them to CGCS2000 to show correct locations.

Map of GaoDe accepts coordinates of GCJ-02 and display them at correct locations without offsets.
When display coordinates  other than GCJ-02 in map of GaoDe, MyBox converts them to GCJ-02 to show correct locations.</PRE>
    <H3>Convert coordinate</H3>
    <PRE>Coordinates of CGCS2000 are real locations and approximate to WGS-84(GPS).
Coordinates of GCJ-02 are  encrypted data with offsets of real locations.
Coordinates of BD-09 and MapBar are encrypted data with offsets based on GCJ-02.</PRE>

<H1>Media Tools</H1>
    <H3>Play Video/Audio</H3>
    <PRE>The media player is based on javafx:
- Supported container types:               
        AIFF, HLS, MP4, MP3, WAV
- Supported encoding types:      
        AAC, MP3, PCM, H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC
- Supported protocals:      
        FILE, HTTP, HTTPS, JAR, HLS</PRE>
    <H3>FFmpeg</H3>
    <PRE>This function is avaliable when FFmpeg has been installed in your env.</PRE>
    <H4>FFmpeg options</H4>
    <PRE>This function is avaliable when FFmpeg has been installed in your env.
Most of players support: muxer "mp4", video codec "H.264", audio codec "AAC".
Notice: "CRF" and "Encoding Preset" only works for x264, x265 and libvpx. 

When function fails, change options and try it again:
- Select supported and better video encoder and audio encoder as your hardwares:
      - When NVIDIA is available, chooce "h264_nvenc" as video encoder, to make use of hardware acceleartion. 
      - Generally, "VideoToolBox" works as video encoder on mac.
- Select options to get suitable settings of your computer, as following factors :
      - The encoder should be fast enough to record without frames dropping.   
      - Consume limited system resources, and leave enough CPU and memory for other applications.
      - Quality and size of the generated file are tolerable.
- Old versions of ffmpeg may be nicer to old computers. On my desktop:
      - ffmpeg of 2019 works smoothly,
      - ffmpeg of 2023 does not accept setting of 'h264_nvenc' and always makes system blocked or dead.</PRE></BR>

    <H4>FFmpeg: Screen Recorder</H4>
    <PRE>- When have not NVIDIA and CPU is not so powerful,
      - Choose "libx264rgb" as video encoder, to bypass conversion from RGB to yuv444p.
      - Select quicker encoding preset. 
      - After recording, use conversion tool to change generated video from RGB to yuv444p with encoder "libx264".
- When no audio input device is detected, check whether it is disabled.(Windows does this by default)

Delay: When button "Start" is clicked, recording will start after this time length.
Duration: Recording will end when time length is reached since starting.  
                User can interrupt recording at once by click button "Stop".

When "Meow" is checked:
MeBenBen will miaow to tell you recording is started.
GuaiGuai will miaow to tell you recording is ended.</PRE>
    <H4>Factor for constant quality mode(CRF)</H4>
    <PRE>The Constant Rate Factor (CRF) is the default quality (and rate control) setting for the x264, x265, and  libvpx encoders.
Lower values would result in better quality, at the expense of higher file sizes.  Zero means lossless and big file.
Higher values mean more compression and quality degradation.

For x264, sane values are between 18 and 28. The default is 23. 17 or 18 can be visually lossless or nearly so. 
For x265, the default CRF is 28.
For libvpx, 31 is recommended for 1080p HD video.</PRE>
    <H4>X264</H4>
    <PRE>A preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio. 
Slower preset provides better quality and occupies more CPU.
Quicker preset means worse quality and less CPU occupation.</PRE>
    <H3>Game: Elimniation</H3>
    <PRE>If more than 3 same chesses are adjacented in vertival/horizantal line, then the line can be eliminated. 
When a chess is eliminated, the chesses above it will move down, and top location will be filled with random chess.
Click 2 adjacent chesses separately to try to exchange their location. If no elimination after exchange,  exchange fails.

Button "Help me" will find a valid exchange for you if any.</PRE>
    <H3>Game: Mine</H3>
    <PRE>Target: Disclose all cells which are not mines. Game fails once a mine is opened.
Rulers:
1) When game is started, all cells are in status "closed".
2) Start timing when click a cell at first time.
3) Count: Opened cells number / Total number of cells which are not mines.
4) When left-click a cell, nothing happens when it is "disclosed", or else:
      - If it is a mine, then game fails.
      - If it is not a mine, then it is opened and its status becomes "disclosed".
      - If there are mines around this cell, then the number of mines around it is shown in the cell.
      - If there is no mine around this cell, then it is shown as blank and all cells around it will be disclosed. Continue this process.
5) When right-click a cell, nothing happens when it is "disclosed", or else:
      - If this cell is not marked, then mark it as "Mine".
      - If this cell is marked as "Mine", then change its mark as "Suspected".
      - If this cell is marked as "Suspected", then remove its mark.
      - Right-clicking only marks the cell, and will not trigger mine nor disclose the cell.
6) When double-click a cell:
      - If the cell is in status "closed", then disclose it.
      - Disclose all cells which are not marked as "Mine" around this cell.
      - Do this only when you are sure all mines are marked correctly around this cell.
7)When you are unlucky to trigger a mine:
     - Click button "Undo", to pretend that did not happen and continue the timing and counting.
     - Click button "Replay", to restart the same game.
     - Click button "New Game" to start a different game.
8)Click button "Help me" to see all mines secretly, and click button "Undo" to continue playing.</PRE>
